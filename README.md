To build a Line Following Robot (LFR), follow these 5 simple steps:

Step 01: Learn about the components
Open the file “Component_Info”.
It contains all the details and pin connections you need.

Step 02: Design the robot body
Open the file “Body_Structure_Design”.
Use it to make a simple and nice design for your LFR.

Step 03: Assemble the components
Assemble all the components on the chassis.
Use the pin connections given in “Component_Info”.

Step 04: Test sensors and motors
Open the folder “Arduino_code”.
   => Use “lfr_ir.ino” to test the sensors
   => Use “motor_test.ino” to test the motors

Step 05: Upload the final code
Finally, open “Arduino_code” and upload “last_code.ino” to run the robot.
